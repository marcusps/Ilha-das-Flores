1
00:00:01,15 --> 00:00:04,38
This is not a work of fiction.

2
00:00:04,38 --> 00:00:19,25
There is a place called "Island of Flowers"

3
00:00:19,25 --> 00:00:26,07
We are in Belém Novo, municipality of Porto Alegre, state of Rio Grande do Sul, in southern Brazil,

4
00:00:26,07 --> 00:00:34,58
more precisely at 30 degrees, 12 minutes and 30 seconds South, and 52 degrees, 11 minutes and 23 seconds West.

5
00:00:34,58 --> 00:00:40,96
We are currently walking in a tomato plantation, and we can see ahead, standing, a human being, in this case, a japanese man.

6
00:00:40,96 --> 00:00:47,51
The japanese are distinguished from other human beings by the shape of their eyes, their black hair, and by their characteristic names. 

7
00:00:47,51 --> 00:00:49,65
The japanese man in question is called

8
00:00:49,65 --> 00:00:51,84
Suzuki.

9
00:00:51,84 --> 00:00:56,39
Human beings are biped mammals, and distinguish themselves from other mammals, like whales,

10
00:00:56,39 --> 00:01:03,81
or bipeds, like chickens, mainly by two characteristics: a highly developed telencephalon, and opposable thumbs.

11
00:01:03,81 --> 00:01:09,51
The highly developed telencephalon allows human beings to store, associate, process and understand pieces of information.

12
00:01:09,51 --> 00:01:17,23
The opposable thumb allows human beings a tweezer-like finger movement, which in turn allows for precise manipulation.

13
00:01:17,23 --> 00:01:23,48
The highly developed telencephalon combined with the tweezer-like finger movement allowed human beings

14
00:01:23,48 --> 00:01:28,76
to make innumerable improvements to their planet, including

15
00:01:28,76 --> 00:01:31,42
growing tomatoes.

16
00:01:31,42 --> 00:01:34,15
Tomatoes, unlike whales, chickens, and japanese people

17
00:01:34,15 --> 00:01:36,15
is a vegetable.

18
00:01:36,15 --> 00:01:41,25
Fruit of the tomato plant, tomatoes started being cultivated in the 1800s for its nutritional qualities.

19
00:01:41,25 --> 00:01:45,15
Around 61 million tons of tomatoes are produces on Earth every year.

20
00:01:45,15 --> 00:01:51,90
Mr Suzuki, despite working almost 12 hours daily, is responsible for a very small fraction of this production.

21
00:01:51,90 --> 00:01:56,92
The main use of tomatoes is the feeding of humans.

22
00:01:56,92 --> 00:02:03,24
Mr. Suzuki is a japanese man, and, therefore, a human being.  Despite this, Mr. Suzuki does not grow tomatoes with the intention to eat them. 

23
00:02:03,24 --> 00:02:08,91
Almost all tomatoes grown by Mr. Suzuki are delivered to the supermarket in exchange for money.

24
00:02:08,91 --> 00:02:16,98
Money was most likely created as an initiative by Giges, King of Lidia, a great kingdom in Asia Minor, in the 7th centure before Christ.

25
00:02:16,98 --> 00:02:19,91
Christ was a jew.

26
00:02:19,91 --> 00:02:24,40
Jews have a highly developed telencephalon  and opposable thumbs.

27
00:02:24,40 --> 00:02:28,52
They are, therefore, human beings.

28
00:02:28,52 --> 00:02:32,16
Until the creation of money, the economy was based on the direct exchange of goods.

29
00:02:32,16 --> 00:02:35,56
The difficulty of calculating the amount of tomatoes equivalent to a chicken

30
00:02:35,56 --> 00:02:41,51
and the difficulty of the direct exchange of chickens for whales where the main motivations for the creation of money.

31
00:02:41,51 --> 00:02:45,68
Starting in the thrid centure BC, any action of object made by human beings

32
00:02:45,68 --> 00:02:50,68
fruit of the collaboration between the highly developed telencephalon  and the opposable thumbs, 

33
00:02:50,68 --> 00:02:57,80
as well as all living things, above and below ground -- tomatoes, chickens and whales -- can be exchanged for money.

34
00:02:57,80 --> 00:03:02,15
To facilitate the exchange of tomatoes for money, human beings created supermarkets.

35
00:03:02,15 --> 00:03:07,47
Ms. Anete is a Roman Apostolic Catholic biped mammal.

36
00:03:07,47 --> 00:03:13,59
She has a highly developed telencephalon and opposable thumbs.  She is, therefore, a human being.

37
00:03:13,59 --> 00:03:19,00
She came to this supermarket in order to exchange her money for tomatoes, amongst other things.

38
00:03:19,00 --> 00:03:23,72
Ms. Anete obtained her money in exchange for the work she performs.

39
00:03:23,72 --> 00:03:29,47
She uses her highly developed telencephalon and opposable thumbs to exchange perfumes for money.

40
00:03:29,47 --> 00:03:36,56
Perfumes are liquids usually extracted from flowers, which make human beings smell more pleasantly than they would naturally.

41
00:03:36,56 --> 00:03:42,98
Ms. Anete does not extract the perfumes. She exchanges them, at a factory, for a determined amount of money.

42
00:03:42,98 --> 00:03:49,84
Once that is done, Ms. Anete walks from house to house, exchanging the perfumes for a slightly larger amount of money.

43
00:03:49,84 --> 00:03:52,49
The difference between these two amount is called

44
00:03:52,49 --> 00:03:54,24
profit.

45
00:03:54,24 --> 00:03:58,79
Profit, which was once forbidden to Catholics, is today allowed for all human beings.

46
00:03:58,79 --> 00:04:07,84
Ms. Anete's profit is small compared to the factory's profit, but it is enough to be exchanged for 1kg of tomatoes and 2 kg of meat -- in this case, the meat of a pig.

47
00:04:07,84 --> 00:04:12,65
Pigs are mammals, like humans and whales, but quadrupeds.

48
00:04:12,65 --> 00:04:18,14
They sever as food for the Japanese, the Catholics, and the remaining human beings -- with exception of the Jews.

49
00:04:18,14 --> 00:04:25,66
The food that Ms. Anete exchanged for money, which she exchanged for perfumes extracted from flowers, will be consumed by her family during a single day.

50
00:04:25,66 --> 00:04:30,92
A day is the time interval that it takes for the Earth to spin all the way around it's own axis.

51
00:04:30,92 --> 00:04:34,43
Mid-day is lunch time.

52
00:04:34,43 --> 00:04:43,22
A family is a community formed by a man and a woman, united in matrimony, and by the children born out of this union.

53
00:04:43,22 --> 00:04:48,49
Some of the tomatoes Mr. Suzuki exchanged with the supermarket for money, and which were in turn exchanged for the money 

54
00:04:48,49 --> 00:04:54,84
that Ms. Anete obtained as profit in the exchange of perfumes extracted from flowers were transformed into sauce for the pork.

55
00:04:54,84 --> 00:05:01,95
One of these tomatoes, which according to Ms. Anete was in no condition to become sauce, was thrown in the garbage.

56
00:05:01,95 --> 00:05:09,10
Garbage is all that is produced by human beings, in a collaboration between the highly developed telencephalon and the opposable thumbs

57
00:05:09,10 --> 00:05:13,91
and that, according to the opinion of some human being, is in no condition to become sauce.

58
00:05:13,91 --> 00:05:19,84
In a city like Porto Alegre, inhabited by over a million human beings, produces around 500 tons of garbage daily.

59
00:05:19,84 --> 00:05:24,12
Garbage attracts all kinds of germs and bacteria, which in turn cause disease.

60
00:05:24,12 --> 00:05:27,95
Diseases seriously harm the normal functioning of human beings.

61
00:05:27,95 --> 00:05:32,63
Even when it does cause disease, the apearence and aroma of garbage are extremely unpleasant.

62
00:05:32,63 --> 00:05:41,81
This is why garbage is taken a determined places, very far, where it can freely soil, smell badly and attract disease.

63
00:05:41,81 --> 00:05:46,00
In Porto Alegre, one of the places chosen for garbage to smell badly and attract disease is called

64
00:05:46,00 --> 00:05:51,92
Island of Flowers

65
00:05:51,92 --> 00:05:56,62
An island is a portion of land surrounded by water from all sides.

66
00:05:56,62 --> 00:06:04,14
Water is a odorless, insipid and discoloured substance, formed by two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

67
00:06:04,14 --> 00:06:08,77
Flowers are the reproductive organs of plants, usually scented and with bright colours.

68
00:06:08,77 --> 00:06:15,09
Pleasantly smelling flowers can be turned into perfume, like the ones Ms Anete exchanged for money, which she in turn exchanged for tomatoes.

69
00:06:15,09 --> 00:06:19,14
There are few flower at the Island of Flowers.

70
00:06:19,14 --> 00:06:25,25
There is, however, a lot of garbage, and amongst it, the tomato Ms. Anete judged inadequate for the pork sauce.

71
00:06:25,25 --> 00:06:29,91
There is also a lot of pigs.

72
00:06:30,24 --> 00:06:34,50
The tomato Ms Anete judged inadequate for the pork she was serving as food for her family

73
00:06:34,50 --> 00:06:39,64
 may turn out to be a great meal for a pig and its family, in the opinion of th epig.

74
00:06:39,64 --> 00:06:46,98
It is important to remember Ms Anete has a highly developed telencephalon  and opposable thumbs, while pigs don't even have thumbs, let alone opposable ones.

75
00:06:46,98 --> 00:06:51,27
Pigs have, however, an owner.

76
00:06:51,27 --> 00:06:57,07
A pig's owner is a human being, with a highly developed telencephalon, opposable thumbs and money.

77
00:06:57,07 --> 00:07:04,04
The pig's owner exchanged a small part of his money for a small plot of land in the Island of Flowers, thus becoming the owner of the plot.

78
00:07:04,04 --> 00:07:08,04
A plot of land is a patch of land which has an owner and a fence.

79
00:07:08,04 --> 00:07:14,57
This plot, where garbage is thrown, was fenced so that the pigs would not be able to go out, and so that human beings would not come in.

80
00:07:19,00 --> 00:07:25,83
The employees of the pig's owner separate the organic matter which they think is fit for the pig's consumption from the garbage.

81
00:07:25,83 --> 00:07:29,85
Organic matter is anything that was once living, in either animal or vegetable form.

82
00:07:29,85 --> 00:07:33,35
Tomates, chickens, pigs, flowers and paper are all organic matter.

83
00:07:33,35 --> 00:07:42,34
This piece of paper, for example, was used on a history test for high school students at the Nossa Senhora de Dores school,  and was given to the student Ana Luiza Nunes, a human being.

84
00:07:42,34 --> 00:07:48,42
A history test is a test for the capacity of a human being's telencephalon  to remember data related to the study of history.

85
00:07:48,42 --> 00:07:52,94
For example: who as Mem de Sá? What were the hereditary captaincies?

86
00:07:53,31 --> 00:07:55,43
To remember is to live.

87
00:07:55,43 --> 00:08:01,64
Some organic materials, like tomatoes and history tests, are given to pigs as food.

88
00:08:01,64 --> 00:08:07,33
That which they consider inapropriate for the feeding of pigs, is used to feed women and children.

89
00:08:08,46 --> 00:08:17,02
Women and children are human beings, with a highly developed telencephalon, opposable thumbs and no money.

90
00:08:20,19 --> 00:08:23,69
They don't have an owner, and what is worse, they are many.

91
00:08:23,69 --> 00:08:31,39
Being many, they are organized by the employees of the pig's owner into groups of 10, and they have the permission to go inside the fenced area.

92
00:08:33,12 --> 00:08:42,02
Once inside the fenced area they can choose for themselves all the food the employees of the pig's owner judged innadequate for the pigs.

93
00:08:42,72 --> 00:08:50,20
The employees stipulated that each group of 10 human beings has 5 minutes to stay within the fenced area

94
00:08:50,20 --> 00:08:55,75
collecting organic matter, like tomatoes and history tests.

95
00:08:55,75 --> 00:09:00,55
5 minutes are 300 seconds.

96
00:09:00,55 --> 00:09:11,52
Since 1958, the second was defined as the equivalent of 9 billion, 192 million, 631 thousand and 770 cycles of radiation from a Cesium atom.

97
00:09:11,52 --> 00:09:15,82
Cesium is a non-organic material found in the garbage in Goiânia.

98
00:09:21,03 --> 00:09:26,03
The tomato, planted by Mr. Suzuki, exchanged for money at the supermarket,

99
00:09:26,03 --> 00:09:33,84
exchanged for the money that Ms Anete exchanged for perfumes extracted from flowers, rejected for the pork sauce, thrown in the garbage,

100
00:09:33,84 --> 00:09:38,39
rejected as food by the pigs, is now available for all the human beings at Island of Flowers.

101
00:09:44,75 --> 00:09:49,26
What places the human beings at the Island of Flowers after the pigs in the priority for food choice

102
00:09:49,26 --> 00:09:53,63
is the fact they have no money.

103
00:09:59,72 --> 00:10:09,12
Human beings distinguish themselves from other animals by the highly developed telencephalon, opposable thumbs, and by being free.

104
00:10:10,63 --> 00:10:14,85
Free is the state of a person with freedom.

105
00:10:15,32 --> 00:10:19,03
Freedom is a word fed by human dreams, 

106
00:10:19,03 --> 00:10:21,42
that no one can explain,

107
00:10:21,42 --> 00:10:24,66
and that nobody cannot understand.
